  <div>Notes:
    <p>
      The nature of flex box is it's forgivable.
      Flexbox will always try to work with the best possible otherwise it will break.
      the item is `flex-wrap: wrap;`
      Flex items will try to stretch across the container they are in.
      When you turn the wrap up, it will stretch and then split.
      You can also do a wrap reverse, which will always change the axis that we are going to be using.
      Can pair this with the flex-column. This will make the container work with columns.
      Calc can use the percentage.
      for example width:calc(33% - 20px);
      Otherwise there is the ability to use the padding.
      Can go on the flex item instead.
