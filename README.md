# What The Flexbox?!

NOTES NOTES NOTES

- Everything to know about flexbox

1 - INTRO
- There is a lot of combination of property values that we have to use
- 13 are the main fundamentals
- The 7 are real life examples

2 - INTRO TO flexbox
- display: flex; is how to initiate
- have to put floats, percentages and everything that we usually do
- start with a container
- container goes across the whole page - like a block element
- if you make the container a flex it will make the children flex items
- vh - viewport height, make the container stretch the entire area. * not to do with flexbox but still good to get set up

3 - Flex Direction
- Flex direction sets the axis when you are coding what you are doing
- CSS tricks - complete guide to flexboox - shows how you can centre the content
- flex-direction - row + column
- row side by side
- column going down
- row main axis - left to right & cross axis going from top to bottom
- column main axis - going down ( boxes go down ) & cross axis goes from left to right
- axis controls where it goes, cross axis is how the children fit into the container
- row only really if we are unapplying what is going on
